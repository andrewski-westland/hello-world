<h1>Now This Is What I call a Website</h1> <p>Websites are <strong> very</strong> difficult to put together. However, thanks 
to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started" title="HTML Page" target="_blank"> this
awesome website</a>, I came to understand how to put a website together.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this is <em> only </em> the <em> beginning </em>, and I will be able to continue to make some kick-butt websites. Just 
be grateful that this website wasn't about your <strong> Mother </strong>. It would have been, but I
figured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._T" title="Mr T Wiki" target="_blank"> Mr. T </a> would have been disappointed. See
ya on my next website</p>
